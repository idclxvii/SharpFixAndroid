===============

What is it?
-----------

ShaprfFixAndroid is a File Management Utility for mobile phones using 
Android Operating System. It automatically performs the tasks of file 
administration such as file duplication deletion and file segregation.
It is targeted for Android 2.3 (Gingerbread – API Level 10) and above.

The utility aims to maintain the SD-Card directory of the mobile device
to be free of duplicate files as well as properly segregated with respect
to its file types. It scans the whole SD-Card directory as well as the 
sub directories and performs the appropriate tasks according to the user’s
settings and preferences. 

The project demonstrates on how to develop and interact with the 
Android Platform which includes accessing the File System, devising different
threading models, applying appropriate computing concepts 
(parallel computing, concurrent computing, etc.)and testing different
algorithms’ efficiency and performance.
 

Core Features:

- User Login and Password
	* Users can configure Autologin which bypasses the Login authentication
- File Duplication Detection
	* Deletes duplicated files
	* Users can turn this feature on/off
	* Users can choose which file to be deleted when duplicated files has
		been detected, from older/newer files 
- File Designation
	* Moves a certain file type to a specified directory
	* This enables users to automatically segregate, for example, all
		JPEG files in a separate folder on their phone's directory.
	* Users can CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE File Designation Rules.
	* This feature bases its file type recognition through reading the file
		so even if a file with a wrong file extension can be properly designated
- Filters
	* Just like the common Anti-virus programs, Users can set directories and/or
		files to be ignored by the scans. Please note that File Duplication
		Detection and File Designation has separate scans. A file or directory
		filtered in a File Designation rule, will not be ignored by the File
		Duplication Detection scan.
	* Users can turn on/off Filtering
	* Users can CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE Filter rules
	* File Duplication Detection and File Designation has its separate filters
- Services
	* Allows the user to enable/disable Scheduled Scan
	* Scheduled scans are like ALARMS, which allows the user to set his
		preferred time and repetition when SharpFix initiates its scans
	* Users can turn on/off notifications when SharpFix is doing scans
	* Users can enable/disable update notices
	* Users can start/stop scans directly
